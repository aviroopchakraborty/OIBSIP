### Car Price Prediction

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. **Car price prediction** is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So I want to learn how to train a car price prediction model and I have made this project.
